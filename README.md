# Bank Note Authentication.

End to End Implementation:

Data were extracted from images that were taken from genuine and forged banknote-like specimens. For digitization, an industrial camera usually used for print inspection was used. The final images have 400x 400 pixels. Due to the object lens and distance to the investigated object gray-scale pictures with a resolution of about 660 dpi were gained. Wavelet Transform tool were used to extract features from images.

Deployed using various methods:

1.) Local Host

"Local host" usually refers to the host machine or device that you are using to access it. For example, if you are running a web server on your computer and accessing it through a web browser, your computer would be the local host. You can access the local host by using the loopback address 127.0.0.1.

If you are running a server on your local machine and want to access it from another device on the same network, you can use the local IP address of your machine. You can find the local IP address of your machine by running the ipconfig command on Windows or the ifconfig command on macOS or Linux.
